                <h2>Discover Wales</h2>
                <p class="lead">
Wales is known by many as ‘God’s beautiful land’ or simply, ‘The lost Eden’. These names are in view of its natural beauty, which is incomparable to say the least, in is one of the best well-kept secrets by the Welsh population who live in its backyard. With its own language, customs and iconic flag, Wales is a fascinating country which boasts a wealth of culture to see and discover
</p>
 <h2>History</h2>
                <p class="lead">After the Romans left Britain in the 5th century, Britain divided into several different cultures which spoke their own languages. Wales was the largest of these settlements and began to be known as Wales. 
Since 1282 the heir apparent to the English monarch has been known as the “Prince of Wales”. During the 15th and 16th century the Welsh launched several revolts against the English, which were all unsuccessful.In 1707 Wales become part of the Kingdom of Great Britain, and then in 1801 they became part of the United Kingdom retaining much of their culture under this new ruling.
</p>
<h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p class="lead">Wales covers 8,023 miles of land with large sections of the landscape being mountainous regions like Snowdonia and Brecon Beacons. Most of its towns/villages are coastal with the longest coastal path in the UK stretching over 1000km! There are three national parks and five areas of outstanding natural beauty, which cover a quarter of the land mass of Wales. 80% of the land is dedicated to agriculture, ranging from crops to livestock.

The largest mountains in the north are part of the Snowdonia range, with the largest mountain being Snowdon at 1,085 metres. There are over 1300 kilometres of coastline ranging from long flat sandy beaches to towering cliffs.</p>
                <h2>Attractions</h2>
				
				<p class="lead">Wales boasts of three of the UK’s top 10 beaches with Rhosilli Bay ranking 3rd. Wales has 5 of the top 10 waterfalls in the UK. Dramatic mountains and sweeping hillside, sandy beaches and Victorian promenades, ancient imposing structures and mouthwatering local cuisine – we’re not describing some exotic, far flung destination, this is Wales, and it has it all.

Based on the west coast of dear old Blighty itself Wales is a dream to get to, with trains and coaches galore, and only a few hours drive along the motorway from most of England. Whether you’re a history buff or a thriller seeker looking for an action packed break, or simply after a relaxing stay by the seaside with maybe some light sunbathing and a few ice creams thrown in, Wales has something for everyone.
</p>
<h2>Cuisine</h2>
                <p class="lead">The Welsh cuisine is very similar to that of the other British nations with the most popular meat being lamb which is unsurprising as sheep are the most farmed animal in Wales. 
A traditional Welsh roast dinner comprises of lamb and mint sauce.The national vegetable is leek and is used regularly in dishes prepared in the country. Faggots and Shepherd’s Pie are dishes associated with British culture but actually originated in Wales.
A Glamorgan sausage is dish that is unique to Wales and is a combination of cheese, eggs and breadcrumbs in the shape of a sausage.
